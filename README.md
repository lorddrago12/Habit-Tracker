# 📅 Habit Tracker 

A simple **monthly habit tracker** built using **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project visually tracks daily habit completion for the current month and saves progress using **browser localStorage**.

Built to practice:
- DOM manipulation
- Date handling
- Persistent state in the browser
- Clean UI logic separation

## 📂 Project Structure

```
project/
├── Index.html   # Page structure
├── style.css    # Styling and layout
├── script.js    # App logic (calendar, storage, interaction)
```

Each file has a clear responsibility to keep the project easy to understand and maintain.

## 🧠 How the App Works 

1. Detects the **current month and year**
2. Generates a calendar dynamically based on the number of days
3. Lets the user:
   - Set a habit name
   - Click days to mark them complete
4. Saves completion data in **localStorage**
5. Displays a live completion counter
6. Allows resetting the tracker

No backend, no frameworks — everything runs in the browser.

## 🧩 Index.html — Structure

The HTML provides:
- A title showing the **current month**
- A habit title (clickable to edit)
- A container for the calendar grid
- A completion counter (`completed / total days`)
- A reset button

The calendar days themselves are **not hardcoded** — they are generated by JavaScript.

---

## 🎨 style.css — Styling

The CSS handles:
- Full-screen background image
- Centered calendar layout
- Rounded card design
- Grid-based calendar using `CSS Grid`
- Circular day buttons
- Visual state for completed days

Key visual features:
- 7-column grid (like a real calendar)
- Highlighted completed days
- Current day outlined automatically

## ⚙️ script.js — Logic Breakdown

### 📅 Date Handling
- Detects:
  - Current month
  - Current date
  - Current year
- Automatically calculates how many days are in the month

This ensures the tracker updates correctly every month.

---

### ✍️ Habit Title
- Clicking the habit title prompts the user to enter a habit
- The text updates immediately on the page

(Simple and intentional — no storage yet)

---

### 🗓️ Calendar Generation
- Creates one clickable element per day
- Assigns a unique ID to each day
- Highlights the **current date**
- Checks localStorage to restore completed days

Each day:
- Toggles completion on click
- Updates the counter
- Saves its state in localStorage

---

### 📦 Persistence (localStorage)
Each day is stored using a unique key:
```
month-day-year
```

This allows:
- Reloading the page without losing progress
- Tracking habits month by month

---

### 🔢 Completion Counter
- Automatically updates whenever a day is clicked
- Displays:
```
completedDays / totalDays
```

---

### 🔄 Reset Button
- Clears all stored data for the current month
- Resets UI state
- Resets the counter to zero

---

## 📝 Notes

This project is intentionally simple and beginner-friendly.  
The goal is to understand **how a real interactive web app works** without relying on frameworks.
